# Plan
- Blow up bomb
- Physics!
- Targets
- Obstacles
- More attachment types (incl delete) — ui for this
- Attachment purchase process, cost
- Tutorial
- More levels

# planning structure
- root is the bomb
- bomb, and attachments, can have children
- attachment needs to have a “type”
- placing an attachment follows surface of existing items?
	-	OR you spawn an attachment on something specific and move it around the surface. way easier than snapping and shit
