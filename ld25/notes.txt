[Story]
Money. Its all about the damn money. To make everything "fair" it was decided
in the year 2025 to make it so everyone had access to the trade markets. The
problem? You only get one shot. For one hour.

Everyone is given a preset amount of cash and once you start trading, you have
one hour to make as much money as you can. Whats going on behind the trades?
It doesn't matter any more. Its just a system.

Once the hour is up, you'll still be able to connect to the system but you can
no longer trade. No longer make more money. You failed? Whelp, your boned. 

Don't fail.

[Game]
The point of the game is to make money on contracts with a prisoner's dilemma
twist. Either or both of the players involved in a contract can choose to
backstab the other with the "evil" versions of the offer and accept commands.
If neither uses the evil version, both players profit. If both are evil, both
loose everything invested as well as the contract slot for its duration. And
if only one is evil, then they take all of the money for themselves.

Since you only have one hour to make as much money as you can, picking who you
make deals with and if you screw them over is paramount. To facilitate this
players can chat globally (say) and privately (tell) and can see info about
players (about). 

To aid in this, a reputation system is in place. Each player starts with 10
reputation. When a contract completes, both players involved can rate the
contract interaction in the range of -3 to +3. This is applied to the other
player and is reflected on their public reputation.

[Contracts]
Contracts are how you make money. To create a contract, one player makes an
offer to another with the contract details. The other player can choose to
accept or reject the contract. Once accepted the contract lasts the specified
duration. Any one player can only have a maximum of 5 open contracts at a 
time. The \"offer\" and \"accept\" have evil versions called \"eviloffer\" and 
\"evilaccept\", the effects of which are described in \"help game\".

The parameters of the offer commands are:
  - offer <investment1> <player> <investment2> <duration>

investment1 - The investment of the offering player
player - The player you are making the offer to
investment2 - How much the other player is supposed to invest
duration - How long the contract lasts in minutes if accepted

Profit multipliers increase with duration. At 1 minute, each player makes
back their investment plus the average of both investments and at 5 minutes
each makes back their investment plus 16x the average of their investments!
